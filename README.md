From testing we found that simply using indicators was not enough to find tops and bottom and even mean reversion often did not work due to irrational investors and market risk

Hence, instead of longing at a potential lows, we wanted to test the returns of longing only in the middle of a new uptrend, vice versa

Our strategy is as such:

**Long when**
1. Close Between (50-day SMA) and (50-Day SMA + Long ATR Multiple * ATR) 
        i.  A stronger signal is when Difference between (SMA & Close) is large
2.  AND (MACD line(Fast)– Signal(Slow)) is also Positive and large
        i. A stronger signal is when Diff between (MACD line(Fast)– Signal(Slow)) is large
3.  14 Day ATR SMA > ATR 
        i.  A stronger signal is when Difference between (ATR SMA & ATR) is large

**Short when**
1. Close Between (50-day SMA) and (50-Day SMA - Short ATR Multiple * ATR) 
        i.  A stronger signal is when Difference between (SMA & Close) is large
2.  AND (MACD line(Fast)– Signal(Slow)) is also Negative and large
        i. A stronger signal is when Diff between (MACD line(Fast)– Signal(Slow)) is large
3.  14 Day ATR SMA < ATR 
        i.  A stronger signal is when Difference between (ATR SMA & ATR) is large

For each day, our strategy will invest in the stock with the **Strongest Signal** and untill that position is closed it will stay invested in that stock
