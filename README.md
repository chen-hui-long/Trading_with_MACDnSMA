From testing we found that simply using indicators was not enough to find tops and bottom and even mean reversion often did not work due to irrational investors and market risk

Hence, instead of longing at a potential lows, we wanted to test the returns of longing only in the middle of a new uptrend. 

Our strategy is as such:

**Long when**
1. Adj Close is between  50 day SMA value & (50 day SMA value + 3x ATR) 
        i.  A stronger signal is when Diff between (SMA & Adj Close) is large
2.  AND (MACD line(Fast)– Signal(Slow)) is also positive and large
        i. A stronger signal is when Diff between (MACD line(Fast)– Signal(Slow)) is large

**Short when**
1. Adj Close is between (50 day SMA value - 0.5x ATR) &  50 day SMA value 
        i.  A stronger signal is when Diff between (SMA & Adj Close) is large
2.  AND (MACD line(Fast)– Signal(Slow))  is also negative and large 
        i. A stronger signal is when Diff between (MACD line(Fast)– Signal(Slow)) is large

For each day, our strategy will invest in the stock with the **Strongest Signal** and untill that position is closed it will stay invested in that stock
